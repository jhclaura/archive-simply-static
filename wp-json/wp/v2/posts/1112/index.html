As an artist, I can start from<\/span><\/p>\n<pre>&quot;love&quot;<\/pre>\n<p>, start from developing deeper and knowing thoroughly about what I love, and then gradually, with the creative interventions, I can bridge worlds between public and the field where my passion lies. \u00a0Quoted from Anna &#8220;<em>&#8230; my stories tell how advocacy for mushrooms can lead to projects for democratic science and publicly inclusive wellbeing.<\/em>&#8220;, I&#8217;m inspired to search what I&#8217;m crazy about and immerse myself in it. Before that, I don&#8217;t really understand the goal of this class now I&#8217;ve found it. It&#8217;s not about just trying to use fungi in your projects and trying to involve Led, motor, Arduino, but trying to intervene this mysterious field with your point of view. Then as a messenger, you expose the rarely-knew info and make it connect to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, simplifying and more comprehensive project update:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.jhclaura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-19-08.08.44.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1114\" alt=\"2014-02-19 08.08.44\" src=\"http:\/\/www.jhclaura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-19-08.08.44.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"729\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.jhclaura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-19-08.08.44.jpg 600w, http:\/\/www.jhclaura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-19-08.08.44-246x300.jpg 246w, http:\/\/www.jhclaura.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2014-02-19-08.08.44-304x369.jpg 304w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Idea<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One line description:<strong> See the world through fungus<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">I want to build up connections between fungus and people, and further take fungus as a bridge to connect people with the world beyond fungus.
