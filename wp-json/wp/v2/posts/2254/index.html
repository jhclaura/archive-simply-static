I grew up pursuing high grades, good college, and proper stable jobs, and kept my fantasy and daydreaming well within leisure time and doodling. After graduated, I&#8217;d worked as macro economic analyst for 2 years, forecasting &#8220;far to reach&#8221; numbers in the market manipulated by many big hands, and I gradually became numb and the job became just task. Thus I decided to change the life path when I still can, and desire to do <strong>something that will only end good if you pay enough efforts in it<\/strong>. Something is not made by talking but made by hand. Learning 3D animation was my first step, and then I was in ITP.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/<\/p>\n<p>Reviewed my past projects, I concluded myself\u00a0<strong>a graphic person who want to do physical stuff<\/strong>. In the coding worlds, everything is so perfect, yet\u00a0in the real world, everything is so against my\u00a0will. I don&#8217;t know why I kept challenge myself with\u00a0to do physical stuff\u00a0even I know I&#8217;ll spend extra time on fabrication than other people. The connections of physical &amp;\u00a0physical, physical &amp;\u00a0graphics just fascinate me.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the projects can roughly summarized\u00a0as<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>animated<\/li>\n<li>fantasy realization<\/li>\n<li>lighthearted<\/li>\n<li>trying to be weird<\/li>\n<li>hoping to be provoking<\/li>\n<li>and most of them were out of self desire.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been focus on web based <strong>3D graphic<\/strong> using Three.js since Spring 14&#8242;, and extended to <strong>virtual reality<\/strong> exploration.
