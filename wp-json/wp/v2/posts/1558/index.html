With the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/12\/15\/nyregion\/elevator-accident-kills-a-woman-in-a-madison-avenue-building.html?_r=0\">freak accidents<\/a> elevators usually function in the same way. Press the button, wait, get in and awkwardly attempt not to look at other people, get off.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">As routine as elevator rides may be, we imagined disrupting the routine of elevator usage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In the style of old train tickets, we created an elevator ticket and instructed visitors to the NYU Tisch building that a ticket was required for using the elevator.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Using the reasoning of \u2018safety\u2019 and \u2018efficiency\u2019 we asked visitors for his\/her destination floor and collected tickets prior to boarding the elevator. The ticket was not presented as an option but instead as a requirement to use the elevator.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The responses varied from mild amusement, to annoyance and non compliance. It was interesting that most elevator users accepted the reasoning of \u2018efficiency\u2019 or \u2018safety\u2019 at face value, even as we were not dressed in a way that might suggest authority.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We imagined that to enhance the\u00a0performance we could\u00a0\u00a0dress\u00a0in uniform and have operators standing inside of the elevator asking for tickets from passengers and pressing floor button for them. During the ride the operator could talk about the imaginary floor news and wish passengers a merry imaginary scenario day when arriving.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the first week assignment &#8211;\u00a0a simple immersive performance, to put a new slant on an everyday situation or interaction.Ben, Tom and me present the Elevator Ticket!
